# Support Vector Machine Explorations

This repository contains practical examples and Jupyter notebooks on Support Vector Machines (SVM), exploring different SVM kernels and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing SVM algorithms in machine learning.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Support Vector Machines
- Linear SVM Classification
- Non-linear SVM Classification with Kernel Tricks
- Hyperparameter Tuning in SVM
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting continuous outcomes

## Notebooks:-

SVM_Basics.ipynb - Introduction to the basic concepts of SVM.
SVM_Kernels.ipynb - Demonstrations of various kernels such as linear, polynomial, and RBF.
SVR.ipynb - An example of using SVR for a regression problem.

#Tools and Technologies:-

Python
scikit-learn
Python Notebook
pandas
